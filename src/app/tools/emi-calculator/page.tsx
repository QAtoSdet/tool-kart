    question: "How is EMI calculated?",
    answer:
      "EMI uses the standard reducing-balance formula: P × r × (1+r)^n / ((1+r)^n − 1), where P is the principal, r is the monthly interest rate (annual rate ÷ 12 ÷ 100) and n is the number of months.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this work for home, car, personal and gold loans?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The EMI formula is the same across loan types — just enter the loan amount, annual interest rate and tenure for your case, whether it is a home loan, car loan, personal loan or gold loan.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a good tenure to choose?",
    answer:
      "A longer tenure lowers the monthly EMI but increases the total interest you pay. A shorter tenure means a higher EMI but less total interest. Use the yearly breakdown to compare.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this account for processing fees or prepayment?",

      "This is a standard EMI estimate and does not include processing fees, insurance or prepayment. Treat the result as a close estimate for planning, then confirm exact figures with your lender.",

              Plan your loan with a clear EMI estimate
            </h2>
            <p>
              Your EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment) is the fixed amount you pay each month until a
              loan is cleared. This calculator shows your EMI, the total interest you&apos;ll pay and
              the total amount — so you can compare loans and tenures before committing.

              Home, car and personal loan EMIs
            </h3>
            <p>
              The same calculator works for every loan type. For a home loan you might enter a
              large principal over 15–20 years; for a car or personal loan, a smaller amount over
              3–7 years. The yearly breakdown shows how much of each year&apos;s payments go to
              interest versus principal, so you can see how the balance reduces over time and
              compare two tenures before you decide.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tip: a small change in the interest rate or tenure can change your total interest
              significantly. Try a few combinations to find an EMI that fits your monthly budget
              without paying too much interest overall.
